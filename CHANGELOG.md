   files.

   imports.

### 0.19.0

      unnecessary XML namespaces appearing in template fragments or re-rendered
      templates.
    - Update JSDOM dependency from 9.x to 16.x.

### 0.18.1
 - Allow variable expressions in 'template name' part of the fragment expression
   ([#35](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleafjs/pull/35))

### 0.18.0
 - Added support for message expressions `#{...}` and a `messageResolver`
   configuration function.
 - Fix TypeError when calling native JS methods within expression language
   blocks

### 0.17.2
 - Adding `th:alt` as a removable attribute
 - Allow escaped single quotes in strings
   ([#23](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleafjs/issues/23))

 - Dialects can now add expression objects to the processing context

### 0.16.0
 - Added support for the `all-but-first` value of the `thjs:remove` processor.
 - Added support for `thjs:datetime` -> `datetime` HTML attribute
 - Small performance tweaks to address 'over re-processing' of templates.

### 0.15.1
 - Fix for the `th:if` processor not causing the element to be reprocessed once
   removed

### 0.15.0
 - Added a `thjs:unless/data-thjs-unless` processor
   ([#25](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleafjs/pull/25))

 - Added support for parameters passed in fragment expressions
 - Added support for element processors and Thymeleaf's `th:block` element
   processor

### 0.14.0
 - Method calls (`#...` in variable expressions) supported, though they don't
   really do anything as their are no expression objects in the Thymeleaf
   context just yet
 - Updated minimum supported Node version to 8

   ([#24](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleafjs/issues/24))

### 0.13.1
 - Template names in fragment expressions can have `/` in their name (as they
   are often paths to a file)

### 0.13.0
 - Add support for string concatenation (string literals or expressions that
   return strings and any combination of the 2)

### 0.12.1
 - Add support for parsing the iteration status variable (though nothing is done
   with it) to round out support for the iteration expression

   special hacks required to get template insertion working!

### 0.11.1
 - Restoring `href`/`src`/`value` processors lost in the last update

### 0.11.0
 - Whitespace no longer significant in parsing most expression types
 - Parsing errors are output to the log in built mode and no longer thrown so
   that they don't bring down the whole thread

### 0.10.0
 - Add a `th:value`/`data-th-value` processor
 - Add support for if-then expressions (`(condition) ? (true branch)`)
 - Add support for a literals (text, number, boolean, and tokens)
 - Add a `th:checked`/`data-th-checked` processor

### 0.9.0

   to include other templates/fragments (still a hack that's documented in the
   README).
 - Include Node 8 in CI builds/tests as it's now entered LTS.
